# Coffee Shop Daily Revenue Prediction
 
This project uses machine learning to predict the daily revenue of a coffee shop based on key operational and marketing factors.
The dataset (2,000 records) includes customer traffic, order values, operating hours, staffing levels, marketing spend, and foot traffic.
The goal was to identify the most influential factors driving sales and to compare two tree-based ensemble models: Random Forest and XGBoost.

# Dataset Description
*Columns:* 
1. **Number_of_Customers_Per_Day**: The total number of customers visiting the coffee shop on any given day
2. **Average_Order_Value**: The average dollar amount spent by each customer during their visit
3. **Operating_Hours_Per_Day**: The total number of hours the coffee shop is open for business each day
4. **Number_of_Employees**: The number of employees working on a given day. This can influence service speed, customer satisfaction, and ultimately, sales
5. **Marketing_Spend_Per_Day**: The amount of money spent on marketing campaigns or promotions on any given dayThe number of people passing by the coffee shop per hour, a variable indicative of the shop's location and its potential to attract customers
6. **Location_Foot_Traffic**: The number of people passing by the coffee shop per hour, a variable indicative of the shop's location and its potential to attract customers
7. **Daily_Revenue**: This is the dependent variable representing the total revenue generated by the coffee shop each day

# Model Performance Comparison
| Metric           | Random Forest |    XGBoost    | Interpretation                |
| :--------------- | :-----------: | :-----------: | :---------------------------- |
| **MSE**          |   47,501.55   | **45,758.71** | Lower → better                |
| **RMSE**         |     217.95    |   **213.91**  | XGBoost has ~2% smaller error |
| **R²**           |     0.949     |   **0.951**   | Both excellent                |
| **Cross-Val R²** |     0.946     |  ≈ **0.950**  | Stable across folds           |

XGBoost slightly outperformed Random Forest — achieving 95.1% explained variance and only ~$214 average daily error (≈7% of mean revenue).

# Findings and Conclusion
Both Random Forest and XGBoost demonstrated excellent predictive power on this dataset.

Number of Customers, Average Order Value, and Location Foot Traffic were the strongest predictors of revenue. Marketing Spend also showed a positive but less consistent influence.

The XGBoost model achieved the highest accuracy and generalisation, making it the recommended choice for deployment.

Final Accuracy: R² = 0.951  RMSE ≈ $213.91

The model accurately predicts daily revenue within ~7% error on average.
