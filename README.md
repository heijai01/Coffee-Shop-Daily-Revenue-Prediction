# Coffee Shop Daily Revenue Prediction
 
This project uses machine learning to predict the daily revenue of a coffee shop based on key operational and marketing factors.
The dataset (2,000 records) includes customer traffic, order values, operating hours, staffing levels, marketing spend, and foot traffic.
The goal was to identify the most influential factors driving sales and to compare two tree-based ensemble models: Random Forest and XGBoost.
